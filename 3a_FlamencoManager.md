## Step 1: Confirm Subscription

After the previous steps, you should be able to assign your users a Cloud Subscription.    
If the subscription is not showing up in Blender Cloud, go through the Blender Cloud user settings until the user links up. If there are still issues, make sure that in Blender ID the user has been assigned `cloud-subscriber` and `cloud-has-subscription` roles.
